# keys

`o` - spawn `open` script for URL
`b` - open URL in browser

## global

`q` - exit
`r` - reload all feeds
`C-r` - redraw screen

users are not expected to read items in the application (there will be no super cool reading program like newsboat, an external program should be used). they will be presented 

# how to store read items

plaintext file (that is easy to awk)

hash:_date_:_feed url_:_title_:_url_:_podcast download url_
(delimiter should be very obscure, but consistent (for awking))

sqlite (yuck, but maybe)

# subcommands

ideally, feef will integrate with fzf/dmenu and other programs, by providing useful output

default: start ui
list: list
